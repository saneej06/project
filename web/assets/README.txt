Banner assets placeholder

- To use your own video, put it at: assets/banner.mp4
  Recommended formats: MP4 (H.264) and/or WebM (VP9/AV1)

- To use your own poster image, put it at: assets/banner-poster.jpg (or .png/.svg)

- The site will automatically fall back to a remote sample video if a local file is missing or if the page detects a local absolute path (e.g., C:\... or file://).

- If you want me to add your specific video file to the project, upload it in the repository (or tell me where I can fetch it) and I'll place it in the correct path and update the markup.
